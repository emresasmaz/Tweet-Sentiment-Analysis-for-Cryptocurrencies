# Tweet-Sentiment-Analysis-for-Cryptocurrencies

In this project, we investigated sentiment analysis for cryptocurrencies. Because we believed that there is a strong relation between tweets and cryptocurrency prices. For the study, we choose one cryptocurrency (NEO) altcoin, and related tweets obtained from Twitter. Data collection and cleaning were essential and one of the main contributions of the study. To prepare the data, 5 years of daily tweets with NEO hashtags were taken from Twitter. The downloaded tweets were filtered to make contain or mention only NEO. To do sentiment analysis on tweets we used Machine learning techniques to classify tweets into positive, negative, and neutral sentiments. We trained and tested a Random Forest classifier on our data the test set reached 77\%. In the second phase of the study, we investigated whether the tweets sentiment were corelated with cryptocurrecy price. To do that we created a data frame which has the daily price and number of the tweets classified into different sentiment classifiers by the Random Forest classifier that was previously trained. Using this data, we made a sentiment analysis. We looked for a correlation between these sentiments and the NEO price. Neutral sentiments were found to be more correlated to the NEO price with a rate of 45\%. We also tried the same process with the BERT-ready model. As a result, positive sentiment was more correlated to the NEO price, with a 46\% rate.
